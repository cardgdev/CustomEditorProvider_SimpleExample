# About

The simplest possible CustomEditorProvider example. The [official example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/custom-editor-sample) is complex and does a poor job advancing new users from 0 to 1.

# Usage

Open any file with the `.myext` extension and vscode should open an editor displaying "Hello world".

Check `extension.ts` for the logic.
